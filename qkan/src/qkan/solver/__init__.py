QKAN solver backends.

Each solver is implemented in its own module:
- torch_exact: Pure PyTorch reference implementation
- flash: Triton fused kernels
- cutile: cuTile (NVIDIA Tile Language) fused kernels
- cutn: cuQuantum tensor network contraction
- qml: PennyLane quantum circuits
- qiskit_solver: IBM Quantum backends via Qiskit Runtime
- cudaq_solver: NVIDIA CUDA-Q backends (GPU-accelerated simulation or QPU)
